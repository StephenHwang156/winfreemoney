      <h1 class= "title"> What You Should Order At Starbucks </h1>
      <br><br>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p align="left"> What is one coffee store that we see just as often as Tim Hortons in Canada?<p>
        <br>
        <p align="left"> The answer is Starbucks!<p>
        <br>
        <p align="left"> Starbucks offers comfortable and cozy environment, along with nice decorations that attracts people into checking out the store. <p>
        <br>
        <p align="left"> Well, this article will give you some recommendations to what you should get when you visit the store.
          If you like the flavour of matcha/greentea and you are craving for something cold and refreshing, I recommend the Greentea
          Frappuccino. It is cold, refreshing, and delicious. The greentea flavour adds a bit of bitterness that evens out the sweetness
          so the drink is not too sweet. It is topped off with some freshly whipped cream. Although I do recommend cutting the syrup
          by 1/5 for optimal sweetness.</p>

        <br>
        <p align="left"> However, if you are not a fan of their Frappuccino, I have another recommendation, their Mango Dragonfruit Refresher with Lemonade.
          It is abosultely refreshing and light which is good if you are not a fan of the heavy whipped cream and iced mixture. This is a perfect drink
          for any day. </p>
        <br>
        <p align="left"> Here are my recommendations and I hope you will enjoy it!!! </p>
        <br>
        <p align="left"> Note: Both drinks contain some caffeine so think about it before purchasing it. Although I think they are good subsitutes
          for coffee when you want some caffeine but not too much that you start feeling weird from it. </p>
